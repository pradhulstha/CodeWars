# CodeWars

About Codewars:
Codewars is a community of developers, which are called Code Warriors (or just warriors), that train on improving their development skills. Think of it like a coding dojo - where developers train with each other and help each other get better through practice.

My Solutions:
As a software developer, I like new challenges that come up with software programming and I was recommended by my freind ti try Codewars to challenge myself to improve my programming skills and get familarized with new ideas.
